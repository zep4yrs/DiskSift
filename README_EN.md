# Pinkbin

**Scan. Understand. Clean — one folder at a time.**

Open-source disk cleaner. Scan a whole drive in seconds to see where the bytes went, drag any unfamiliar folder into the AI to learn what it is and whether it's safe to delete, then clean by scope — defaults to the Recycle Bin, never reads your file contents.

|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | [`Diskwise_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe`](https://github.com/cccyd2003-qwq/pinkbin/releases/latest) (NSIS)<br>[`Diskwise_x.x.x_x64_en-US.msi`](https://github.com/cccyd2003-qwq/pinkbin/releases/latest) (MSI) | First launch: SmartScreen will block — click "More info" → "Run anyway". NTFS MFT direct read needs admin; the installer ships a manifest that auto-elevates via UAC. |
| **macOS** | [`Diskwise_x.x.x_universal.dmg`](https://github.com/cccyd2003-qwq/pinkbin/releases/latest) | First launch: allow it under System Settings → Privacy & Security. |
| **Linux** | [`Diskwise_x.x.x_amd64.AppImage`](https://github.com/cccyd2003-qwq/pinkbin/releases/latest) / `.deb` | `chmod +x` the AppImage and double-click. Falls back to cross-platform walker, slower than Windows. |

## Three things

Pinkbin only does three things:

### 1. Show how the disk is allocated

Direct read of the Windows NTFS Master File Table (jwalk fallback on other platforms). Full C: drive in **2–5 seconds**. Renders a colored treemap and a single-line 22px-row tree view — at a glance you can see `D:\xwechat_files` taking 80GB, `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Docker` taking 50GB.

### 2. Drag any folder into the AI to ask "what is this"

See an unfamiliar folder? Drag it from the left tree (or the path on the right) into the **central chat panel**, and the AI explains what it is, whether it's safe to delete, and what you'd lose. BYOK — bring your own Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini key, or run Ollama locally for free.

**Pinkbin only sends directory metadata** to the AI (path names, size, file count, extension distribution, up to 20 sample paths). **It never reads file contents.**

### 3. Known apps get a dedicated cleanup scaffold

Some apps are mainstream, eat real disk, and have a clear cleanup boundary — for those we ship a **cleanup scaffold** (one TOML + one Rust integration test). Users can clean each scope individually right from the Studio card. **Currently shipping two**:

- **WeChat for PC** (3.x + 4.x dual support) — 22 scopes covering caches, received media, chat backups. Never touches chat DBs, favorites, Moments, or `CustomEmotion`.
- **Conda environments** — recycles stale envs as a single directory (when `conda-meta/history` mtime is older than 90 days). Base env is permanently grayed out.

**What's coming**: Steam shadercache · Chrome cache · Docker buildx · HuggingFace models · npm/pnpm/pip cache · OBS recordings · IDE indices — mainstream apps with significant disk usage and clear cleanup boundaries, added one by one through the 14-phase workflow with red-line integration tests guarding every glob. **Why we cut the previous 36 legacy scaffolds**: nobody had verified their glob boundaries, creating a real risk of deleting user data (e.g. the old `node-modules` scaffold matched Cursor / VSCode / game-bundled `node_modules` directories).

All deletes go to the **system Recycle Bin** by default — recoverable. Every action writes `~/.diskwise/undo.jsonl`; optional 7-day quarantine.

---

## Usage

1. **Download the installer** [(above)](#download), install, the Diskwise icon shows up on your desktop
2. **Open → top-right ⚙ to configure AI** — recommended: local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) (free, no key); or paste your Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini API key
3. **Top "Pick a disk or folder" → click Scan** — 2–5 seconds later you see the treemap + tree view
4. **Hit an unfamiliar large folder?** Drag it into the chat panel and ask the AI; or look at the right-side Studio for any already-detected scaffolds (WeChat, conda)
5. **Before deleting**: defaults to Recycle Bin; high-risk operations (chat-backups etc.) require two-step confirmation; tick dry-run to preview what would be deleted

## Roadmap

- [x] **v0.1** — basic scan + treemap + tree view + drag-to-AI analysis
- [x] **v0.2** — Windows NTFS MFT direct read (88× faster) + WeChat 4.x rewrite + Conda env card + cut 36 unverified scaffolds
- [ ] **v0.3** — undo UI (consume `undo.jsonl`) + zoomable treemap drilldown + Markdown rendering polish (shipped)
- [ ] **v0.4** — **more built-in cleanup scaffolds**: Steam · Chrome · Docker · HuggingFace · npm/pnpm/pip · OBS · IDE indices… every one with safety tests guarding red lines
- [ ] **v0.5** — native fast scanner on macOS / Linux (APFS Spotlight / btrfs subvol)
- [ ] **v0.6** — scaffold marketplace (user submissions, community-validated, version-controlled)

---

## Contributing

The most valuable contribution is **writing a new cleanup scaffold**. Each app is one PR:

1. Write the requirements doc under [`docs/scaffold-requirements/`](docs/scaffold-requirements/) (red lines: chat DBs? account keys? user favorites?)
2. Actually run the app on your machine, use `Glob` to enumerate the real directory tree, find the cache-vs-user-data boundary
3. Copy [`scaffolds/_templates/scaffold.toml`](scaffolds/_templates/scaffold.toml) and write the TOML
4. Copy [`crates/scaffold/tests/_templates/scaffold_safety.rs`](crates/scaffold/tests/_templates/scaffold_safety.rs) and write the safety test (**positive + red-line assertions**, CI runs this — no test, no merge)
5. `pnpm tauri dev` to verify the card renders
6. Open the PR — the template walks you through 14 checklist items

[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) users: just type `/add-scaffold <id>` from the repo root and the 14-phase workflow kicks in.

Full workflow: [`.claude/commands/add-scaffold.md`](.claude/commands/add-scaffold.md).

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cccyd2003-qwq/pinkbin.git && cd pinkbin
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev            # desktop app (first build compiles Rust deps, 5-15 min)
pnpm -C apps/desktop dev  # frontend only, browser-based debugging, mock backend
cargo test --workspace    # workspace tests
```

Requires **Node 20+ · pnpm 9+ · Rust stable · Tauri prerequisites** (on Windows: VS Build Tools 2022 + WebView2).

## License

[MIT](LICENSE) · fork it, sell it, fork it closed-source — go ahead. But **the scaffold safety tests are a social contract** — if you fork and modify a scaffold, please keep the safety tests in sync. Removing red-line assertions in exchange for "more aggressive cleanup" is the failure mode we're explicitly defending against.
